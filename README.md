# 🚀 Pentaho ETL & Data Engineering Portfolio

Welcome to my central repository for **Pentaho Data Integration (PDI/Kettle)**!

This project documents my journey from fundamental ETL concepts to advanced data engineering workflows. It serves as a unified portfolio combining academic coursework with practical, real-world solutions developed during my internship at **Itaipu Binacional**.

## 🎯 Objectives
- **Master ETL Pipelines:** Orchestrate complex Extract, Transform, and Load processes.
- **Database Integration:** Manage high-performance connections with **PostgreSQL** using **DBeaver**.
- **Advanced Scripting:** Extend standard PDI capabilities using **Java** (User Defined Java Class) and **JavaScript** for custom logic.
- **Cross-Platform Deployment:** Transition and manage workflows from Windows to **Linux** environments.
- **Professional Application:** Apply academic concepts to solve real corporate data challenges.

## 📂 Project Structure & Sources
This repository is organized into three main pillars:

1. **Coursework (PT-BR):** Fundamentals, Data Warehousing concepts, and DB setup based on *Pentaho Data Integration: Do Básico ao Avançado*.
2. **Advanced Labs (English):** Scripting and optimization techniques from *Pentaho for ETL & Data Integration Masterclass*.
3. **Internship Projects (Itaipu Binacional):** Selected workflows and snippets developed during my time as a Software Development Intern. 
   > *⚠️ **Note:** All internship projects uploaded here have been sanitized. Sensitive data, internal credentials, and proprietary business logic have been removed or replaced with generic placeholders for demonstration purposes.*
